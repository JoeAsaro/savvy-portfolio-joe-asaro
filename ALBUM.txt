        `[The Glitch Mob's] sophomore album returns with the pulsing, headbang-worthy songs that initially commanded their fans' attention. -- Consequence of Sound.net`,
        `In the end, what really made this entire work stick out and worthy of such a high ranking is the creativity that went behind the entire process. Considering this is The Glitch Mob's only second album and they've released it through their own self run label, Glass Air Records, they've created quite a stir. -- Earmilk`,
        `If you liked Drink the Sea, this is an evolution [from the band's initial sound]. There are clear references to their original sound, but The Glitch Mob has successfully branched into a new overall feel. -- Craig Apfelback, Amazon.com`
